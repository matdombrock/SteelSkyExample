# SteelSky Example Project

This is an example project for the [SteelSky](https://github.com/matdombrock/SteelSky) static site generator.

To get started just run:
```
git clone https://github.com/matdombrock/SteelSkyExample
cd steelsky
npm install
```

You can edit what's in the existing `source` directory or delete it and start from scratch. 

To generate your static site, from the root project directory run:
```
steelsky
```

This will create new files in your `out` directory which can be published to a web server. 

You can delete the contents of `out` before generating to start fresh.
